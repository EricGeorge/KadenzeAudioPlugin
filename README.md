# Kadenze Delay Audio Plugin

This is the plugin we developed as a project for the Kadenze/Output class Advanced Audio Plugin Development:  https://www.kadenze.com/courses/advanced-audio-plugin-development.
To build it, download the latest versin of JUCE:  https://shop.juce.com/get-juce/download.  I used version 5.4.3.  Open the ProJucer file and generate the project.
I limited my use and testing to XCode 10.2 on macOS 10.14.4 and build the Audio Unit target and tested in Ableton Live 10.0.6.

Have fun learning JUCE and I highly recommend the Kadenze/Output courses.
